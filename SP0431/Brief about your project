Movie_Recommendation_System
We developed Movie Recommendation System using AIML, #The goal of a movie recommendation system is to address the challenge of information overload in the vast landscape of available movies. With thousands of movies released each year across various genres, it can be overwhelming for users to navigate and select movies that align with their preferences.
